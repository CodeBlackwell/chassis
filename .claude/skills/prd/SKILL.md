# PRD Generator

Build a PRD formatted for either **Ralph Solo** (single iterating agent) or **Ralph's Army** (multi-agent with waves and domain isolation).

**CHASSIS conventions:** save bundles under `prds/<feature-slug>/` (copy `prds/_example/` for the file shapes); the universal gate is `just lint && just test`; the runner is `scripts/ralph.py`; `lib/contracts.py` is frozen and owned by nobody.

---

## Step 1: Ask Mode + Scope

Ask the user TWO things upfront:

**1. Mode:** Ralph Solo or Ralph's Army?
- **Solo** — one agent iterating through `PRD.md`, one task per iteration. Best for <20 stories, single-domain work.
- **Army** — multiple agents in waves with file ownership. Best for 20+ stories, multi-domain, parallelizable work.

**2. Feature description:** What are we building?

If the user already specified mode or feature in their prompt, skip asking for that part.

---

## Step 2: Clarifying Questions

Ask 3-5 essential questions with **lettered options** so the user can respond quickly ("1A, 2C, 3B"):

```
1. What is the primary goal?
   A. [option based on feature]
   B. [option]
   C. [option]
   D. Other: [specify]

2. What is the scope?
   A. Minimal viable version
   B. Full-featured implementation
   C. Just backend/API
   D. Just the UI
```

Focus on: problem/goal, core actions, scope boundaries, success criteria.

---

## Step 3: Size Stories

**THE #1 RULE: Each story must be completable in ONE context window (~10 min of AI work).**

Ralph spawns fresh per iteration — no memory of previous work. Too-big stories = broken code.

### Right-sized:
- Add a database column and migration
- Add a single UI component
- Update one API endpoint with new logic
- Add a filter to a list

### Too big — MUST split:
| Too Big | Split Into |
|---------|-----------|
| "Build the dashboard" | Schema, queries, UI components, filters |
| "Add authentication" | Schema, middleware, login UI, session handling |
| "Refactor the API" | One story per endpoint |

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it's too big.

---

## Step 4: Order by Dependencies

Stories execute in priority order. Earlier stories must NOT depend on later ones.

**Correct:** Schema → Backend logic → UI components → Dashboard views
**Wrong:** UI component (needs schema that doesn't exist yet) → Schema

---

## Step 5: Write Acceptance Criteria

Each criterion must be **verifiable** — something Ralph can CHECK.

### Good (verifiable):
- "Add `status` column with default 'pending'"
- "Filter dropdown has options: All, Active, Completed"
- "Typecheck passes"

### Bad (vague):
- "Works correctly"
- "Good UX"
- "Handles edge cases"

**Always include** the lint/test gate (in CHASSIS: `just lint && just test` passes) as the final criterion. For UI stories also add `"Verify changes work in browser"`.

## Output Format: Ralph Solo

Save `PRD.md` and `progress.txt` under `prds/<feature-slug>/`.

### PRD.md structure:

```markdown
# PRD: [Feature Name]

## Introduction
[2-3 sentences: what it does, who it's for]

## Goals
- [Specific, measurable goal]
- [Another goal]

## User Stories

### US-001: [Title]
**Description:** As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Specific verifiable criterion
- [ ] Another criterion
- [ ] Typecheck passes

### US-002: [Title]
...

## Non-Goals
- [What this does NOT include]

## Technical Considerations
- [Known constraints, components to reuse]
```

### progress.txt:

```markdown
# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---
```

---

## Output Format: Ralph's Army

Save these files under `prds/<feature-slug>/` (create directories if needed):
- `PRD.md` — master plan with roster, waves, ownership map
- `agents/<name>-agent.md` — one per agent, contains stories + file ownership
- `progress/progress-<name>.txt` — one per agent, checkbox tracker + completion signal

### Context Budget Rule

Each agent runs in a single Claude session. Its context load is:
- System prompt injection (~500 tokens, built by `ralph.py`)
- Agent spec file (`agents/<name>-agent.md` — the agent reads this entirely)
- Progress file (grows as agent works)
- Code files the agent reads and writes

**Max 4 stories per agent.** More stories = bigger agent.md = less room for actual code work. If a domain has 5+ stories, split into two agents in the same wave with non-overlapping paths.

| Agent Load | Stories | Risk |
|------------|---------|------|
| Light | 1-2 | Safe — agent has plenty of context headroom |
| Normal | 3-4 | Sweet spot — fills context well without exhaustion |
| Heavy | 5-6 | Risky — split into two agents |
| Overloaded | 7+ | MUST split — agent will lose coherence late in session |

### Agent Sizing Heuristic

Decide agent count by domain decomposition, not story count:

1. List all file paths that will be created or modified
2. Group into non-overlapping domains (no two agents write to same path)
3. Each domain = one agent (merge small domains that are tightly coupled)
4. If a domain has 5+ stories, split by sub-concern (e.g. `api-agent` + `api-tests-agent`)
5. Foundation agent (Wave 0) owns shared infra — schemas, configs, shared libs
6. Polish agent (final wave) gets broad read + narrow write (UI refinements only)

## Notes
(Agent appends learnings here as it works)

Format per story:
## US-XXX: [Title]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- Learnings for downstream agents

---

## Completion Signal
(When all stories done and verified, agent writes delivered tag here)
```

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT put the literal completion tag (`<delivered>COMPLETE</delivered>`) in the template text. Ralph's completion check does substring matching — if the tag appears in instruction text, it will false-positive and skip the agent without it doing any work. Use a description like "agent writes delivered tag here" instead.

---

## Army-Specific Rules

### File Ownership
1. **Every file has exactly one owner.** No two agents write to the same path.
2. **Shared paths are read-only.** An agent can import/read a shared component but cannot modify it.
3. **If two agents need to modify the same file** — restructure so one agent creates it and the other reads it, OR put both stories in the same agent.

### Wave Gating
4. **Wave 0 completes before Wave 1 starts.** All agents in a wave run in parallel.
5. **Validation runs between waves.** Typecheck minimum; test suite if available. The orchestrator runs gate commands before launching the next wave.
6. **A failed gate blocks the next wave.** The orchestrator will not proceed until validation passes.

### Story Namespacing
7. **Story IDs are namespaced per agent.** Foundation: US-001-009, Agent A: US-010-019, Agent B: US-020-029, etc. Leave gaps of 10 between agents for future insertion.

### Git Strategy (Manual)
8. **Optionally, create branch `wave-N/<name>-agent` per agent** before launch. Ralph does not automate branch management.
9. **After a wave completes, merge wave branches into `main`** manually or via script. Validate before launching the next wave.
10. **Same-wave agents never touch the same files** — merges are always conflict-free by design.

### Three-Layer Completion
11. Ralph uses three distinct tags to prevent false positives:
    - `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` — legacy/template only (NEVER triggers completion)
    - `<delivered>COMPLETE</delivered>` — agent writes this when it believes all work is done
    - `<verified>COMPLETE</verified>` — verification Claude writes this after confirming work is actually complete
12. **Agents signal completion** by writing `<delivered>COMPLETE</delivered>` to their progress file. Ralph polls every 15s.
13. **After delivery, Ralph verifies** — launches a separate Claude that checks all tasks are `[x]`, owned files exist, and typecheck passes.
14. **A wave is complete when ALL agents in that wave are verified.**

### Polish Agent
15. **Polish agent (final wave)** gets read access to everything but only writes UI refinements — loading states, error messages, responsive tweaks. No new features.

### Recovery
16. **If an agent fails** (crashes, runs out of context, produces broken code):
    - The orchestrator detects no `<delivered>COMPLETE</delivered>` after timeout
    - Re-launch the agent — it reads its progress file to see what's done vs remaining
    - Progress file acts as checkpoint — completed stories stay `[x]`, agent picks up from first `[ ]`
